# Memory Game Project

## How it Works

This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons. On click  cards are revealed. The Challenge is to match cards in less time with less moves.


## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remeber each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time
