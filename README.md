# Memory Game Project

## How it Works

This is a simple game built to test a users memory. There's a deck of cards with different icons. On click  cards are revealed. The Challenge is to match cards in less time with less moves.


## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Keep revealing cards and working your memory to remeber each unveiled card.
* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

## What I did
I manipulated the DOM with Vanilla JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled (CSS) the game
* created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
* created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
* added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
* create a pop-up modal when player wins game
